NOTE: You might have to add your user to sudoers and the docker group.

Its recomended to use a linux VM.
The containers can be used with OSX and Windows see the make file for instructions.

Remember to add routes in your kali box or set static routes in your router or firewall.

```bash
#Kali VM on the network of the Linux VM(recommended)
ip route add 10.8.10.0/24 via <ip of VM> 
ip route add 10.9.10.0/24 via <ip of VM> 
```

The dns server for the networks is located at 10.8.10.5.
